The chat_hood.sql is based on MySQL v8.0.
Run this script in your database system will create 22 tables and each table will contains some sample data.

The sample_query.sql is based on MySQL v8.0 too.
Don't run this script directly in your database system.
Just copy down some queries you want and implement these queries in the `chat_hood` database.
